create a react application, through which an user can
	- view a list of products
	- view a particular product detail
	- add a new product
	- update an existing product
	- delete an existing product

resources: 
a text file "sample-product-data" has been uploaded in the "case-study" folder in git repo.
the file contains sample product data in JSON format.

the current task is to create a react application and in that create a component which will display all the product records from the given sample data [only first feature to be implemented]

Instructions:
-------------------------
Part-1:

1. use the following command to create a typescript based react application named: pms-app
>npm create vite@latest [choose typescript version]

model: create a model type to represent each product present in the sample product array
2. create a folder "models" inside the "src" directory
3. create a file named, "product.ts" inside the "models" folder
4. now inside the file create a custom type/interface in TS, named "Product" with all the required properties and data types, to represent a model for product [refer the sample product data for the property names and their values to understand the data types, too] and export the same to be used in other files

data: declare an array variable to store the sample data to be used from different components
5. create a folder "repository" inside the "src" directory
6. create a file named, "products.ts" inside the "repository" folder
7. declare an array variable to store the sample data (the array should be of product type array) and export the same to be used in other files

component:
8. create a folder "components" inside "src" directory
9. create a folder "products" inside the "components" directory
10. create a folder "product-list" inside the "products" folder
11. create a file, named, "ProductList.tsx" inside the "product-list" folder
12. display the list of products (present in the products.ts file array) in the component
	Hint: better to save the product array in the component state,in case, in future we need to update the component based on any changes in the product array

13. finally nest the ProductList component in the App component
14. run the application


Part-2:
15. later create a component "ProductRow" in a file "ProductRow.tsx" in a folder "product-row" inside "src/components/products" path
16. this component will receive a product object from parent component through a property and display the product detail thrugh a <tr> element


Part-3:
use the "product-service-backend" supplied through the "backend-server" folder present in the "case-study" folder
a. open the same in  VS Code
b. add an environment file ".env" at the root of the app directory
c. copy the settings present in the "env.txt" file supplied in the "backend-server" folder and paste the same in the ".env" file
d. run the following the script in the terminal: >npm run start


1. run the backend server provided as instructed earlier
2. create a folder "services" in the "src" directory
3. add a file "product-service.ts" 
4. write a function to and add code in it to send an HTTP request to fetch all product records
5. call the function from the "ProductList" component
6. render the data returned
Note: 
a. consider rendering a fallback content while data is being fetched from backend
b. consider rendering a content while error is thrown by the backend server or by network failure
