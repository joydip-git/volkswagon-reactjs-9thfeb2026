create a modular JS app where we will be able to calculate total salary of an employee

there are two types of employees:

developer:
	data members: id, name, basic, da, hra, incentive
	functional member: calculateSalary (accepts no arguments and returns the calculated salary)

hr:
	data members: id, name, basic, da, hra, gratuity
	functional member: calculateSalary (accepts no arguments and returns the calculated salary)

create classes to represent the entities (different types of employees)

the application must maintain an array where new employee objects can be added, updated, removed and fetched.
these functionalities should be present in a separate class, say, employeemanager

you have to call those functionalities from the root file (main file)


create an app structure as the following:
	create "src" directory 
		create a folder "data/repository" to declare an array of employee objects and expory the same
		create a folder "models" in the "src" folder and add files for all the classes to represent the entities and export all of them from individual file
		create  folder "services" and add file for manager class here and export the same
		add a file "index" in the "src" folder


payroll-app
	src
		models
			developer.js			
			hr.js
			<base-class>.js
		services
			manager.js
		data/repository:
			employees.js [an array of employees]
		index.js


compilation and running:
--------------------------------
use "babel" transpiler to get the whole code transpiled into a "dist" folder
use ES6 module format for import/export, but get that module format transpiled into "common js" to run in  node js
create scripts in the package.json and run those scripts to transpile and then run the whole application


Note: steps to follow
-----------------------
1. create the app directory
2. create the package.json file first
	command to create package.json file at the root of the app directory:
	>npm init --y 			
3. install the dependencies next
	babel => 
	>npm i @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs -D

4. create scripts in package.json to transpile the code and run the transpiled root file from the output directory:
	{
		"scripts": {
			"transpile":"babel source-folder-name --out-dir=output-folder-name",
			"app":"node ./output-folder-name/index.js"
		}
	}
5. create .babelrc file and add the configuration so that babel core compiler can use preset-env and transformer for module conversion (es6 to common js)
