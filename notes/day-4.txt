promise api: the job of this api is to execute a method asynchronously without blocking main JS single thread, by delegating the task to another thread in the runtime environments, such as node js or browser.

state property of the promise object created by the api initially has a value "pending", which needs to be updated to either "fulfilled/resolved" or "rejected" by calling Resolve() and Reject() method or Promise object respectively

the result property of the promise object stores the return value of the task/function 

upon getting resolved, the promise api calls the callback method passed to it's then() method and passes the result (in case the method has passed the output to the resolve() method) or nothing to that callback function
upon getting rejected, the promise api calls the callback method passed to it's catch() and passes the reason for error to that callback function

await keyword can be used with a promise ONLY when the awaitable code is written inside a function declared with async keyword

web component based single page application

React JS:
-----------------------
Is a JS library which helps you create web component based single page application
instead of writing the design through pure JS in every component, React JS offers a syntax to do the same, known as JSX  (JavaScript and XML)
a component in React JS is nothing BUT a function which returns a React Element
in this way, in React JS, all components return different React Elements and then a bootstrapper file (main.js) first converts all those React Elements (Virtual DOM) into corresponding HTML elements (HTML DOM) by using "render()" method from React JS library. 

this phase when the whole React JS element tree (VDOM) is  translated into a HTML DOM and then displayed/injected inside the HTML file for the ver first time is known as mounting
