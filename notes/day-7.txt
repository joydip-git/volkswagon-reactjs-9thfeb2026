different ways to create components in React?
---------------------------------------------------
1. function => functional component
2. class    => class component
	
class component properties:
-------------------------------
1. state -> Readonly<{}>
2. props -> Readonly<{}>
3. key	  
4. ref

class component methods:
---------------------------
1. render() -> render a react element (creating vdom for the react component)
2. componentDidMount() -> to write side-effect causing that has to be executed ONLY once during the lifecycle of a component instance. executed after the initial render
3. componentDidUpdate() -> to write side-effect causing code over and again in the lifecycle of a component instance. not executed during the initial render, but from 2nd cycle onwards, inly when the component is updated (by the change in state or by receiving new props from parent)
4. shouldComponentUpdate() -> stops unnecessary rendering. executed before 'render()' method from the 2nd cycle onwards

state -> a property to which you MUST assign an object
in class component ONLY one state object is possible

Hooks in React:
---------------------
Some APIs (functions), with a name, starting with a prefix "use", whose job is to hook a functional component with something, such as 
	1. a state: useState 
	2. a function with side-effect causing code which needs to be executed after the return of the react element from the functional component: useEffect
	3. to memorize a expensive calculation/code (function): useMemo
	etc.

Hooks were introduced in React JS to provide the same facilities that class component enjoys, in the functional component, such as maintaining state, lifecycle, memorize value etc.

Hooks can't be used in class component. Hooks have to be used in a functional component or from a custom hook. hooks should be used at the beginning of the component.

Effect Hook:
---------------------
look at day-6 notes

sharing data:
--------------------
A. in the same component tree:
1. how to pass data from a parent component to a shallow nested component: via props
	[child receiving data from immediate parent]

2. how to pass data from a parent component to a deeply nested component: via context
	via props -> NOT a practical solution


Context:
--------------
an object that can be used to share data across multiple components, provided those components are in the same component tree.
1. createContext<T>() => method to create a context object with T as the type of data to store 
2. In a parent component wrap the component tree inside 
	<ContextObject.Provider value={<data to be supplied>}> 
		... 
	</ContextObject.Provider>

3. In deeply nested component use "useContext()" method and supply the context object as an argument. the hook will return data inside the context object.
 	const data = useContext(ContextObject)


Note: if there are more than one provider for the same context in the component tree, then consumer will get the data supplied by the nearest provider

You can use multiple context for the same component tree
