redux => an implementation of flux design pattern for an unidirectional data flow in any JS framework or library app
famously used in React JS more freqeuently as an application-wide state management technique

redux offers facility to create a shared state(s) as well as create a shared logic to update the shared state
i.e., the state as well as the logic to update the state is "decoupled" from the component. hence both can be shared across multiple component throught application.

store, state, reducer, dispatch, action

packages: 
	1. redux -> redux (legacy), @reduxjs/toolkit (latest)
	2. with react -> react-redux

@reduxjs/toolkit -> 
	1. create a reducer (createReducer)
	2. create action creators (createAction)
	3. create a slice (createSlice)
	4. create a reducer map by combining multiple reducers (combineReducers)
	5. create a store (configureStore)
	etc.

react-redux
	1. connect react app wit redux store -> Provider component
	2. hooks
		a. to select/subscribe a state -> useSelector
		b. get dispatch method -> useDispatch

additional middleware packages:
	1. redux-logger -> logs the whole store [add as dev dependency]
	[with TS based app also install @types/redux-logger package as dev dependency for the data types of redux logger packages for usage in TS]
