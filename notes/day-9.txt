redux => an implementation of flux design pattern for an unidirectional data flow in any JS framework or library app
famously used in React JS more freqeuently as an application-wide state management technique

redux offers facility to create a shared state(s) as well as create a shared logic (present in reducer) to update the shared state
i.e., the state as well as the logic to update the state is "decoupled" from the component. hence both can be shared across multiple component throught application.

store, state, reducer, dispatch, action

packages: 
	1. redux -> redux (legacy), @reduxjs/toolkit (latest)
	2. with react -> react-redux

@reduxjs/toolkit -> 
	1. create a reducer (createReducer)
	2. create action creators (createAction)
	3. create a slice (createSlice)
	4. create a reducer map by combining multiple reducers (combineReducers)
	5. create a store (configureStore)
	etc.

react-redux
	1. connect react app wit redux store -> Provider component
	2. hooks
		a. to select/subscribe a state -> useSelector
		b. get dispatch method -> useDispatch

additional middleware packages:
	1. redux-logger -> logs the whole store [add as dev dependency]
	[with TS based app also install @types/redux-logger package as dev dependency for the data types of redux logger packages for usage in TS]




Error: Actions must be plain objects. 
Instead, the actual type was: 'function'. 

You may need to add middleware to your store setup to handle dispatching other values, such as 'redux-thunk' to handle dispatching functions. See https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#middleware and https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic#using-the-redux-thunk-middleware for examples.


decouple the data fetching logic from component and pass it on to the redux store and self dispatch actions against its own store by itself

solution: use redux-thunk or redux-saga
