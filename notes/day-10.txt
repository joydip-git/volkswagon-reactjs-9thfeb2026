client-side routing:
-----------------------------
React JS talks about client-side routing: loading any component dynamically in the single HTML page of React JS application based on the change in route in the browser

CSR -> client-side rendering
SSR -> server side rendering

Client-side data fetching 
Server-side data fetching

Static-site generation -> SSG

routing through react router
--------------------------------
package: react-router-dom [react-router also will be installed]


1. create routes
	- declarative
		Route component  -> to define each route
		Routes Component -> to register all the individual routes
	- programmatical

2. register all the routes now with router engine
component -> BrowserRouter: A declarative <Router> which uses the browser History API for client-side routing.

pushState() -> History

Link => A progressively enhanced <a href> wrapper to enable navigation with client-side routing without page/app reload. it disbales the feature page/app reloading.
