fetching data from RESTful API server by sending HTTP Request
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. using DOM API: fetch() method
2. using 3rd party API: ex. axios
	
axios:
------------
several methods to send HTTP request:
	get(), post(), put(), delete(), patch(), .....


situation:
---------------------

a component might need to execute an async operation to fetch data from outside system (file, RESTful API etc.) one time, after initial render (some fallback render)

a component might need to execute an async operation repeatedly to fetch data from outside system (file, RESTful API etc.), after initial render (some fallback render)

component lifecycle and useEffect:
----------------------------------------
some code needs to be executed at different point of time frame for a component without any user interaction event (button click etc.)

//register and get an side-effect causing code to be excuted ALWAYS after the component has returned the React element
//do this by passing a callback function with side-effect causing code to the useEffect() method
//also pass an array of dependencies, change in values of any one of those dependencies will cause the side-effect causing to be executed again

useEffect(
	()=>{
		//code to fetch your data
	},
	[] -> optional dependency list
)

what is that callback?
----------------------------
the callback function passed to useEffect method is initially registered with React but not executed immediately
after the component returns the react element, then React will execute the callback function

when it is executed?
---------------------------
as second argument if you pass a dependency list with the value(s), then whenever any of those value(s) changes, immediately the callback will be executed (after the component has returned the initial design)
the dependency list is used to control when the callback function should be executed

if you pass a blank dependency list, then the callback function is executed ONLY ONE TIME till the component has been un-mounted and executed all over again the same component is mounted back in the HTML DOM

useEffect( 
	()=> {//code},[]
)

if you DON'T pass the dependency list as the second argument, the side-effect code (callback) will be executed over and again (every time)

useEffect( 
	()=> {//code}
)

if you pass a dependency list with some value(s), then the callback function is executed whenever and if any of those values change

useEffect( 
	()=> {//code},[value1, value2,..]
)


mounting: rendering the component in the HTML DOM for the very first time
updating: re-rendering the component (creating a fresh VDOM for the component) and updating the existing corresponding HTML element in the HTML DOM
un-mounting: taking the component down from the HTML DOM (NOT making it hidden) completely (destroying the component)

<element hidden = true/false>
