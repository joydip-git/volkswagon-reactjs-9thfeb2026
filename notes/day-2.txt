day-1 discussion:
-----------------------
Introduction to web app using HTML and JS
dev mode web server : Live Server as VS Code extension
JS to make the web page dynamic
DOM (Document Object Model) and DOM APIs (window, console, document etc.)
accessing DOM elements from JS
JS Engine: v8 (chrome), spidermonkey (firefox), JS Core (safari) etc.
runtime environment for JS: Browser and Node JS
Node JS introduction
installing Node JS
executing JS code in Node JS
Introduction to JS:
	data types: string, boolean, number, object
	typeof opeator
	keywords: undefined, null, NaN, Infinity etc.
functions in JS
	function execution context (FEC) and FEC stack
	varobj, this and scope properties of FEC object
Objects in JS
	creation of objects in JS using object literal syntax
	creation of objects in JS using constructor function
	creation of objects in JS using ES6 class
	
strict mode
ECMA, ECMAScript
JS is object-based language which follows "prototype-based programming" model
JS is loosely typed and dynamic language


day-2 discussion:
------------------
closure

ES6+ features:
-----------------------
class, constructor, super, extends keywords
let and const keyword
spread and rest operator
object destructuring
arrow function

callback in JS
JavaScript array and its methods
asynchronity in JS: Promise, async and await keywords

JS modules
module formats
module loaders




JS code execution:
---------------------
1. compilation stage (preparation): JS engine takes care of ONLY the declarations (variable and functions)
2. execution stage


crate a package.json  file:
> npm init --y

transpiler: transformer + compiler
convert ES6+ code into <ES6+ version code for browser backward compatibility
JS => babel compiler

Babel:
---------------
Babel compilet uses a series of "transformers" to convert ES6+ code into <ES6+ version code (vanilla JS)
such as a transformer to convert let keyword into var keyword

plugins: individual package for individual transformer
presets: a package which is a collection of certain plugins

core packages: @babel/core
CLI package: @babel/cli
plugins/presets: @babel/preset-env 


"npm run" CLI command is configured to run a script in package.json file
if in that script any other script/executable name is mentioned, npm will automatically search for it in ".\node_modules\.bin" path. Hence while writing the script no need to provide full path of the executable
for example:  "transpile": "babel src --out-dir=dist"
