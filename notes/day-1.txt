Node JS: a JS runtime with a JS engine (V8) as the backbone for it

1994 - 2008


Java => javac => byte code (IL)
byte code => JVM (JIT) => native code

JS => JS Engine (part of browser)

browser engines:
--------------------
Chrome => JS engine => V8 (C++)
firefox => JS engine => Spidermonkey
safari => JS engine => JS Core (Indigo)
edge, opera => JS engine => v8


Ryan Dahl (2009) => open source V8 engine => modified => Node JS [alternate to the browser runtime]

JavaScript:
-------------------
JS is a loosely typed language. use "var" keyword to declare local variable.
does not have any static type checking

data types:
	string, number, Boolean, object, function

keywords:
	undefined, null, NaN, Infinity

var x = 100

functions:
----------------
1. when any function is invoked in JS, an instance is created for it: Function Execution Context (FEC) which has 3 properties:
	a. variable object: refers to another object where all local variables of the function are stored along with their data
	b. this: refers to another instance where any data declared in the function with 'this' keyword
	c. scope: refers to another object (an array) to store copy of all the outer function scope variable and their values

2. the FEC of a function is placed inside a FEC stack
3. when the function is over, then the FEC, the variable object are destroyed, but the 'this' object is NOT destroyed

Object data type in JS:
any object is a collection of keys/properties and values

in JS the OOP concepts are implemented differently through "prototype-based programming"

1. object-literal syntax
2. constructor function 


JS programming standards/rules etc. are guided by ECMA
ECMA releases a proposal of new features every year (June) -> ES (ECMA Script)

ES 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ..
2015 => ES 6.0

class, constructor, super, extends etc. keywords
let, const etc.
spread operator, object destructuring, rest operator etc.
arrow function
